## Open Questions/Issues
- What is the best approach for embedding PowerPoint presentations? (Microsoft Office Online, Google Slides viewer, or custom solution)
- How should the responsive design handle different screen sizes for embedded presentations?
- Should we support offline viewing of presentations or only online embedding?
- Should we implement a contact form on the about page?
- How should we handle image optimization for blog posts and projects?
